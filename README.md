# Statistical Analysis and Interactive Dashboard Design
The purpose of this project is:
* The object of my research is to produce a single screen interactive dashboard
  which shows a comparative analysis of trade between Developed and Under developed countries based on certain indicators.
* To produce a statistical analysis using the same dataset


### Technologies and Platforms Used
* R
* R-Studio
* PowerBI

## Dataset Description
### World development indicators

The dataset was downloaded from the World Data Indicators (https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators).
Each row on the dataset corresponds to a unique combination of country and year.
Different Series, Time and Country indicators were selected for the dataset. The dataset shows a comparative analysis of trade 
between Developed and Underdeveloped countries from the year 2010 to 2019. 

The countries selected are Canada, Australia, Japan, Germany, United States, United Kingdom, Haiti, Bhutan, Mali, Ethiopia, Guinea, Sudan.
Below are the column codes and the corresponding names:

| Column Name     |  Column Code   | 
|---------|-----------------|
| GDP (current US$) | NY.GDP.MKTP.CD |
| Imports of goods and services (current US$) |NE.IMP.GNFS.CD |
| Exports of goods and services (current US$) | NE.EXP.GNFS.CD |
| Goods exports (BoP, current US$)| BX.GSR.MRCH.CD |
| Service exports (BoP, current US$) | BX.GSR.NFSV.CD |
| Service  imports (BoP, current US$) |BM.GSR.NFSV.CD |
| Imports of goods and services (% of GDP) |NE.IMP.GNFS.ZS |
| Trade in services (% of GDP)  | BG.GSR.NFSV.GD.ZS |
| Merchandise trade (% of GDP)| TG.VAL.TOTL.GD.ZS |
| Exports of goods and services (annual % growth)  | NE.EXP.GNFS.KD.ZG |
| Imports of goods and services (annual % growth)  | NE.IMP.GNFS.KD.ZG |
| Gross savings (current US$) | NY.GNS.ICTR.CD |
| Gross savings (% of GDP)  | NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS |

## Result of the Analysis
There were two files produced from this analysis.
* PowerBI file: this contains the interactive dashboard. It is named `Abdulazeez_Momoh.pbix`.
* R file: this contains R code for statistical analysis. It is named `Abdulazeez_Momoh`.
